# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 Ã— 3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. This project is made using **Kotlin**.
